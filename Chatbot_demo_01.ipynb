        "Because Bert model needs both start and end position characters of the answer, I have to find it and store it for later. Sometimes, I notice that SQuAD anwers \"eat\" one or two characters from the real answer in the passage. For example, (as a colleague said in Piazza) for the word \"sixth\" in passage, SQuAD give the answer of \"six\". So in these cases I select to handle this problem by \"cutting\" the passage by 1 or 2 characters to be the same as the given answer. This strategy is because BERT works with ***tokens*** of a specific format so I needed to process the squad dataset to keep up with the input that BERT is waiting for. "
